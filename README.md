# A/B Testing Analysis for Conversion Metrics Evaluation

This project investigates the impact of a product interface modification on user behavior and conversion metrics. Using historical data on website visits and orders, we calculate conversion rates, visualize cumulative trends, and run statistical hypothesis testing to determine whether the observed differences between Groups A and B are statistically significant.

## Key Steps

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Calculation of core metrics for each experimental group
* Cumulative visualizations of visits, orders, and conversion rate trends
* Outlier detection and filtering
* Statistical significance testing using the Mann-Whitney U test
* Evidence-based interpretation and recommendation

## Outcome

Based on the statistical analysis and cumulative behavior curves, we determine whether the proposed change has a meaningful effect on conversion and whether the new version should be rolled out.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib
* SciPy
